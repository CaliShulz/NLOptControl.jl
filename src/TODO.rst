18) add ! to allPlots()
20) when integrating using :tm :trapezoidal method and minimizing the square of something it may oscillate
22) provide an initial guess
25) parse_DiffEq works OK except when in module
26) what does n.s.reset do

=================
# Low Priority #
=================
1) warn user if final time constraint is active
6) try other linear solvers with Ipopt
14) make functionality to easily compare all integration schemes
15) implement method with variable time steps for :tm methods, that is how it was before!
try to register functions with JuMP
17) change warning from Pkg.add(`` ...) to ""
19) fix pgfplots in mpcdocs
20) get a simple MPC example working?
21) get ride of the index: de=[:(v[j]),:(T[j]-1.625)]
22) make it stop recompiling VehicleModels when it runs PrettyPlots
23) see the number of constraints can be reduced for :ps methods
25) update notebook
27) get ride of n.stateEquations
29) make lgrImplicit default
30) if user only passes n and Expr to NLExpr automatically add n.r.x etc.
