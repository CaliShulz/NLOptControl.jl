TODO

==================
# High Priority #
==================
2) Make test functions
3) fix the solver options
4) fix integration of states for :ps methods
===================
# Medium Priority #
===================
17) make a better way to define diff eqs
18) add ! to allPlots()
19) add params to n.params
20) when integrating using :tm :trapezoidal method and minimizing the square of something it may ossilate

=================
# Low Priority #
=================
1) warn user if final time constraint is active
6) try other linear solvers with Ipopt
12) allow user to select from using the IMatrix or quadrature
14) make functionality to easily compare all integration schemes
15) implement method with variable time steps for :tm methods, that is how it was before!
try to register functions with JuMP
17) change warning from Pkg.add(`` ...) to ""
