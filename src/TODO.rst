#TODO
# 1) why is it failing when we run it again?
# 4) try implicit method to see if that helps
# 6) try other linear solvers
# 9) allow for functions of state constraints of these so we can calculate them on the fly!
# 11) let the user define the objective function above
# 12) allow user to select from using the IMatrix or quadrature
# 13) make a bool to tell the user to restart julia if they change the model significantly -> or do this for them
# 14) make functionality to easily compare all intergration schemes
# 15) implement method with variable time steps for :tm methods, that is how it was before!
try to register functions with JuMP
