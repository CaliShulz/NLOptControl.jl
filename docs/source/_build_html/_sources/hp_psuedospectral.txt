hp-psuedospectral method
========================

To solve the integral constraints within the optimal control problem we employs the hp-pseudospectral method.

The hp-psuedospectral method is an form of Gaussian Quadrature, which uses multi-interval collocation points. While detailed information on this approach can be found `here <http://etd.fcla.edu/UF/UFE0042778/darby_c.pdf>`_. For completeness, this page will cover the basics.

.. math:

  J = \psi(bf{y}(t_0),bf{y}(t_f),bf{q},t_0,t_f)
