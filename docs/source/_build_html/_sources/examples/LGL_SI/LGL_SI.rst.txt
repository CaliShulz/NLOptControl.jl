Legendre Pseudospectral Method with a Single Interval
=====================================================

The code developed in this package uses the Legendre-Pseudospectral Method with Lagrange-Gauss-Lobatto (LGL) nodes. A basic description of this implementation presented in this documentation and :ref:`psuedospectral` and more much more detailed information can be found in both :cite:`Shen2011` and :cite:`herber2015basic`.

We will now look at several examples of this basic functionality.


These examples can be:
  *  Viewed remotely on  using the `jupyter nbviewer <http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/huckl3b3rry87/NLOptControl.jl/blob/master/examples/LGL_SI>`_.
  *  Viewed locally and interacted using IJulia

        To do this:
        ::

           julia>using IJulia
           julia>notebook(dir=Pkg.dir("NLOptControl/examples/LGL_SI"))


Example 1
---------
In the first example, we borrow a problem from `Wikipedia <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaussian_quadrature>`_.


where:
 .. math:: y(x) = 7x^3-8x^2-3x+3

.. sidebar:: Difference between the Wikipedia Example and this Example

  The difference between Wikipedia example and this one is that the Wikipedia example uses Gauss-Legendre Quadrature while the code developed in this package uses Legendre-Pseudospectral Method with Lagrange-Gauss-Lobatto (LGL) nodes. Information on the difference between these methods and many more can be found in both :cite:`Shen2011` and :cite:`herber2015basic`.


* Conclusions

  * We are able to exactly determine the integral
