LGR Single Interval
===================

Basic Problem Definition
-------------------------
The code developed here uses the Legendre-Pseudospectral Method with Lagrange-Gauss-Radau (LGR) nodes. This example demonstrates using the Legendre-Gauss-Radau (LGR) points to calculate the integral and the derivative of a known polynomial function. It can be seen, that it behaves as expected. One, major difference between LGR and LGL is that the LGR method does **NOT** use both endpoints, in fact the LGR method omits the final end point. Researchers at the University of Florida describe this method in many papers including :cite:`a-darby2011hp,a-garg2011advances,a-garg2010unified,a-garg2009overview`.

Examples
--------
In these examples we use:
  * Legendre-Gauss-Lobatto (LGR) nodes
  * Single interval approximations
  * Approximate integrals in the range of ``[x0,xf]``
  * Approximate derivatives in the range of ``[x0,xf]``

These examples can be:
  *  Viewed remotely on  using the `jupyter nbviewer <http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/huckl3b3rry87/NLOptControl.jl/blob/master/examples/LGR_SI>`_.
  *  Viewed locally and interacted using IJulia

      To do this in julia type:
      ::

        using IJulia
        notebook(dir=Pkg.dir("NLOptControl/examples/LGR_SI/"))
