LGR Multiple Interval
**********************

Now, using Legendre-Gauss-Radau (LGR) points with multiple intervals to calculate the integral and the derivative of a known polynomial function. This example demonstrates using the Legendre-Gauss-Radau (LGR) points to calculate the integral and the derivative of a known polynomial function using a **multiple interval approach**.

Functionality
#############

**NOTE:** this is not an exhaustive list and there are help notes for most functions, that can be easily seen by typing:
::

  julia>?  # then press enter and type
           # the name of the function of interest

`LGR_matrices(ps,nlp)`
*************************
* Calculate LGR matrices

  * IMatrix
  * DMatrix

Notes:
------
* Make sure that you calculate these matrices before you try and use them in either `integrate_states()` or `differentiate_state()`.

Examples
#########
In these examples we use:
  * Legendre-Gauss-Radau (LGR) nodes
  * Multiple interval approximations
  * Approximate integrals in the range of ``[x0,xf]``
  * Approximate derivatives in the range of ``[x0,xf]``

These examples can be:
  *  Viewed remotely on  using the `jupyter nbviewer <http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/huckl3b3rry87/NLOptControl.jl/blob/master/examples/LGR_MI>`_.
  *  Viewed locally and interacted using IJulia

      To do this in julia type:
      ::

        using IJulia
        notebook(dir=Pkg.dir("NLOptControl/examples/LGR_MI/"))
