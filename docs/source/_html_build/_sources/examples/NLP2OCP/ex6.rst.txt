NLP and OCP Functionality -> ex#6
===================================
In this example, we are continuing to work on preparing the code for use with optimization by creating higher level functionality. Examine the IJulia notebook to see differences in code.


where:
 .. math:: y(x) = -0.3x^2+3x-0.3

with:
  ::

    Nc = Int64(3); # number of collocation points in each interval
    Ni = Int64(2);  # number of intervals
