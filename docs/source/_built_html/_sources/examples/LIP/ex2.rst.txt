Scaled Lagrange Polynomials-> ex#2
===================================



where:
 .. math:: y(x) = x^3

and the interval from ``x=1`` to ``x=3``

with:
  ::

    N = 2; # number of collocation points

* Conclusions

  * Each scaled Lagrange polynomial passes through a control point
  * The final interpolating polynomial passes through each control point and is exact
