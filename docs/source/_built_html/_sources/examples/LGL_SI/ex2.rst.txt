Example 2
=========
In the second example, we increase the order of the polynomial from ``3`` to ``7``. Then we increase ``N`` until we achieve accurate enough results.

where:
 .. math:: y(x) = 7x^7-8x^6 - 3x^5 + 3x^4 + 7x^3-8x^2-3x+3

Conclusions
-------------
  * We are able to determine the integral very accurately when we increase N to 4
