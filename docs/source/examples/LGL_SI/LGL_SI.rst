Legendre Pseudospectral Method with a Single Interval
=====================================================

In the first example, we borrow this problem from `Wikipedia <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaussian_quadrature>`_.

where:
::
  α₁ =  3;α₂ = -3;α₃ = -8;α₄ =  7;
  γ = Poly([α₁,α₂,α₃,α₄]);

All of the details can be played with
